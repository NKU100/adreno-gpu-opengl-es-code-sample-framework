# Adreno™ GPU OpenGL ES Code Sample Framework

## Overview

This repository contains an OpenGL ES Framework for game and graphics developers to get up and running quickly for creating sample content and rapid prototyping. It is designed to be easy to build and have the basic building blocks needed for creating an Android APK with OpenGL ES functionality including an input system, as well as other helper utilities for loading resources, etc. This Framework has been extracted and is a subset of the [Adreno GPU SDK](https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/adreno-gpu-sdk/tools).

## How to use this Framework

For an overview of the key features and functionality of this Framework please visit the [Framework Overview](OVERVIEW.md) page. Then, visit the [Hello Framework](samples/hello-fw) sample page to get up and running with building, deploying and extending a basic OpenGL ES application.

## Building

This OpenGL ES Framework is designed to be compiled straight into your application's executable, for an example of building instructions specific to a simple use case, look at the [Hello Framework](samples/hello-fw) sample.
